## Overview

This Tableau contains interactive dashboards visualizing NBA player injury risk predictions generated by the custom XGBoost machine learning model. The dashboard displays individual player risk scores, position based injury risk patterns, and detailed player statistics. The visualizations help identify high risk players and position based injury trends to support data driven decisions in sports analytics and player management.

These visualizations are built from the prediction outputs generated by the [AWS pipeline](../aws/README.md), which processes player data through the complete ML pipeline and stores timestamped predictions in S3. The risk scores shown in the dashboard correspond to the same risk categorization system (Low/Medium/High/Critical) implemented in the serverless prediction service.
