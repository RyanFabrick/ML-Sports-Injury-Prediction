    "# NBA Data Explorer Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBADataExplorer class provides methods for exploring and analyzing NBA play by play data from a SQLite database. This class is specifically designed for injury prediction feature engineering and handles the complex relationships between games, players, and play by play events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Connection & Schema Exploration**\n",
    "- **connect()** - Establishes connection to NBA SQLite database\n",
    "- **get_table_info()** - Provides overview of all database tables with record counts\n",
    "- **explore_table_schemas()** - Deep dive into column structures of core tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sampling & Quality Assessment**\n",
    "- **explore_play_by_play_sample()** - Retrieves play by play data with game context via JOIN operations\n",
    "- **get_clean_player_actions()** - Filters out technical events and invalid player records\n",
    "- **test_play_by_play_join_performance()** - Benchmarks query performance for larges cale operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player Analysis & Selection**\n",
    "- **identify_high_usage_players()** - Finds players with substantial game participation for modeling\n",
    "- **identify_modeling_candidates()** - Selects players meeting minimum games/actions thresholds\n",
    "- **analyze_2015_plus_suitability()** - Evaluates player consistency across modern NBA era\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering Foundations**\n",
    "- **get_player_game_aggregation()** - Aggregates play by play events into player game statistics\n",
    "- **create_performance_decline_targets()** - Generates injury proxy variables from performance patterns\n",
    "- **analyze_missing_games()** - Identifies potential injury periods through game absence gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Coverage Analysis**\n",
    "- **get_date_range_analysis()** - Analyzes temporal coverage and data distribution\n",
    "- **get_modern_era_data()** - Focuses analysis on consistent modern NBA period (2015+)\n",
    "- **get_yearly_breakdown_2015_plus()** - Year by year data volume breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**EDA Reporting**\n",
    "- **generate_initial_report()** - Creates complete EDA summary with key metrics and findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Choices Made\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Era Focus (2015+)**\n",
    "- **Load management era** - Start of league wide and mainstream implementation of load management methods and protocols  \n",
    "- **Analytics revolution** - More consistent tracking and statistical methodologies. All areans implemented cameras that track players, practices, games, etc.\n",
    "- **GSW (2015-2016) Effect** - 73 win season arguably altered pace and style league wide \n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Optimization**\n",
    "- **Selective sampling** - Limits for exploration while maintaining representativeness\n",
    "- **JOIN performance testing** - Ensures scalability for feature engineering pipeline\n",
    "- **Clean data filtering** - Removes technical events and invalid records upfront\n",
    "\n",
    "**Injury Prediction Preparation**\n",
    "- **Gap analysis** - Identifies absence periods as injury proxies\n",
    "- **Player consistency** - Ensures sufficient data for reliable modeling\n",
    "- **Rolling metrics foundation** - Enables workload and fatigue indicator creation"

    "**Table Volume Analysis**\n",
    "- **Massive play by play dataset**: 13.6M records. The primary data source for modeling\n",
    "- **Comprehensive game coverage**: 65,698 games across 77 years (1946-2023)\n",
    "- **Rich player metadata**: 3,632 detailed player profiles\n",
    "- **Supporting data abundance**: Officials, inactive players, draft history all well-populated\n",
    "- **Empty table**: team_info_common has 0 records - exclude from pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Coverage**\n",
    "- **Full NBA history span**: 1946 to June 2023 (225 seasons)\n",
    "- **Modern era well represented**: Recent seasons show consistent game counts\n",
    "- **COVID impact visible**: 2020 season reduced to 756 games vs normal 1,200+\n",
    "- **Current through playoffs**: Data extends to 2023 Finals completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance & Feasibility Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Performance Benchmarks**\n",
    "- **JOIN operations viable**: 24.58 seconds for 320k records indicates scalable architecture  \n",
    "- **2023+ data subset**: 319,967 records available for recent analysis\n",
    "- **Processing capacity confirmed**: Large scale feature engineering feasible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Data Quality**\n",
    "- **Event distribution patterns**: Rebounds (type 4) most common, followed by missed shots (type 2)\n",
    "- **Single game depth**: 500 records from one game shows 26 unique players\n",
    "- **Action variety confirmed**: 5 distinct event types in small sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player Selection for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Usage Player Identification**\n",
    "- **Giannis Antetokounmpo leads**: 13,706 total actions across 260 games (52.7 per game)\n",
    "- **Elite player pool identified**: Top 10 players average 40+ actions per game\n",
    "- **Sufficient modeling candidates**: Multiple players with 200+ games since 2020\n",
    "- **Data quality issue noted**: 'None' player entries require filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player Game Aggregation Validation**\n",
    "- **Aggregation pipeline functional**: Successfully converts play by play to player game stats\n",
    "- **Feature categories established**: Field goals, rebounds, turnovers, fouls all trackable\n",
    "- **Temporal context preserved**: Game dates maintained for time series analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Pipeline Readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Infrastructure**\n",
    "- **Database connections stable**: SQLite handling large volumes effectively  \n",
