## Overview

This collection of Python scripts supports this NBA injury prediction machine learning project. The scripts facilitate dataset validation, player statistics exploration, and feature engineering for predicting player injury risk. The scripts work with NBA game data to extract meaningful patterns related to player workload, fatigue indicators, and performance decline that may correlate with injury risk. This supports the development of predictive models for sports analytics and player health management.

- [dataset_validation.py](dataset_validation.py) - Validates the Wyatt Walsh NBA SQLite database structure and assesses data quality for ML viability
- [player_stats_explorer.py](player_stats_explorer.py) - Explores player level game statistics and identifies optimal data sources for individual player analysis
- [static_player_feature_data.py](static_player_feature_data.py) - Generates realistic NBA player feature values based on current season patterns and player archetypes for model testing
